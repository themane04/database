This project was an examination challenge in my school, where we were tasked with designing and developing a database, and our idea was movies. Leveraging the experience and knowledge I had gained from previous projects, I was able to approach this task with a deeper understanding of database design principles, resulting in a more sophisticated and well-structured database.

### Movie Database ERD
Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the movie database, showcasing the relationships between various entities such as movies, actors, and directors:

### Movie Database ERM
The Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) further illustrates the database structure, providing a clear visualization of how data is organized and interlinked:

### Branch Structure and SQL Files
The branch includes a [dedicated folder](movie_database_csv) containing *.csv* files for each table, facilitating easy data management and importation. Additionally, the branch houses three crucial SQL files:

* *create.sql:* Contains SQL commands to create the database schema, defining tables and their relationships.
* *insert.sql:* Comprises SQL statements for inserting data from the *.csv* files into the corresponding tables, populating the database with initial data.
* *select.sql:* Features a collection of SELECT queries to demonstrate how data can be retrieved from the database, showcasing the practical application of the database for various use cases.

These files are instrumental in setting up the database, populating it with data, and running queries to extract meaningful information.

This project stands as a testament to my growth in database design, from conceptualization through to the creation of ERDs and ERMs, reflecting a higher level of planning and execution in database development.
