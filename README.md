This project signifies my first venture into designing a city library system, which introduced me to the concepts of Entity-Relationship Models (ERM) and Diagrams (ERD) for the first time.

Below is the ERM I devised for the database. Although it may contain imperfections, it stands as a significant milestone in my learning journey.

Additionally, here is the ERD I developed for the same database. Like the ERM, this diagram has areas for improvement, but it reflects my evolving understanding of database design.

You can find the script used to populate all the tables in the script.py file within this repository. This script is a practical application of the structures defined by the ERM and ERD, showcasing the theoretical design in action.
